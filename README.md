# 🎮 Prototype 3 - Started (Unity Learn)

This project is part of the **Unity Learn Junior Programmer Pathway**.
It covers **Prototype 3** where we focus on **player control, conditional logic, and jumping mechanics**.

---

## ✨ Features

* 👾 Player movement with **basic physics control**
* 🟢 **Jump system** with ground detection
* 🚧 Obstacle spawning and collision detection
* 🎯 Score system for gameplay feedback

---

## 🕹️ Controls

* **⬅️➡️ / A-D** → Move left & right
* **Space** → Jump

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned

* How to use **Rigidbody** and **colliders** for movement
* Applying **if statements** for conditional gameplay logic
* Implementing **ground check** for player jumps
* Using **prefabs** for obstacle spawning
